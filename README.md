# Object-Oriented-Power-Systems
This project is aimed to create free library for evaluation, optimization and simulation of power systems. It is based on previous attemps to write this kind of tool, which has been

General goal is to write series of objects representing main equipment used in power systems like turbines, pumps, boilers, heat exchangers, pipes and other. They can be used alone, but also can be combined to build wide range of power systems like:

* Organic Rankine Cycle
* Claussius-Rankine Cycle
* Combined Cycles ex. gas turbines bottomed with Claussius-Rankine Cycle
* district heating networks

It is based on previous attempts and experience gained from wirting in-house program for Organic Ranikne Cycles, which resulted in PhD thesis prepared in cooperation with Silesian University of Technonology ana Marani Sp. z o. o. 

Abovementioned work was authors first attempt at creating commercial software dedicated for power systems evaluations and was also first program writtend in Python. Many mistakes were made and this project is to build new tool, which will benefit from this experience. Single most important conlusion is that this kind of library has to be written in more flexible way and
