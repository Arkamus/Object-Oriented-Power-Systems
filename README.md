# Object-Oriented-Power-Systems
This project is aimed to create tool for evaluation, optimization and simulation of power systems.

General goal is to write series of objects representing main equipment used in power systems like turbines, pumps, boilers, heat exchangers, pipes and other. They can be used alone, but also can be combined to build wide range of power systems like:

* Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)
* Claussius-Rankine Cycle
* Combined Cycles ex. gas turbines bottomed with Claussius-Rankine Cycle
* district heating networks
